# SentinelStream – Real-Time Fraud Detection Engine

SentinelStream is a high-throughput, real-time fraud detection system designed for FinTech and Neo-banking platforms.  
It processes thousands of transactions per second and identifies suspicious activity in under 200ms using a layered fraud detection approach.

Key Features
- Real-time transaction analysis
- Static rule-based fraud engine
- Predictive risk scoring
- Low-latency processing (<200ms)
- Real-time alerts and monitoring
- Scalable and production-ready design

Use Case
A Neo-bank needs to monitor credit card transactions in real time and prevent fraudulent activity before settlement occurs.

SentinelStream sits between:
- External Payment Gateway  
- Internal Bank Ledger  

It evaluates every transaction and decides whether to **Allow**, **Flag**, or **Block** it.
